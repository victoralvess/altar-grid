# How to run

## Docker

If you have Docker installed, go to the root folder and run `docker compose up`. The `server` will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the client will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Without Docker

To run without Docker, open each project in a terminal.  For both projects run `npm install`. Then, for the `server`, run `npm run build && npm start` and the app wil be available at `http://localhost:3000`. For the `client`, run `npm run dev` and the app will be available locally (the command will tell you in which port).

__NOTE__: the `client` expects the `server` to be available at `http://localhost:3000` because it's hardcoded ðŸ™‚.
